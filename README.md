# Arduino-Line-Follower-PID
Arduino Line follower (*.ino) PID

Correction gained by PID controller is deducted from the motor of the respective side.
(Initially speeds of both motors are set to max)

Maze solving is also available(Left hand rule).

Seperate IR sensors in left and right side for junction identification purpose.

# Turning functions

in functions Left and Right, there is a integer parameter 'state'
input 0 if u want to stop a motor and rotate taking that motor as the axis
input 1 if u want to turn taking the middle of the robot as the axis

P.S Buddhika is soooooooo gay
